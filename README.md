##Tic Tac Toe

A game of [Noughts and Crosses or Tic Tac Toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe) using HTML and CSS only, no JavaScript. It's all done with the `checkbox hack` or, in this case, radio buttons' `checked` property. It uses SVG for scalability and its transitions are inspired by Google's [Tic Tac Toe](https://www.google.com/search?q=tic+tac+toe).
